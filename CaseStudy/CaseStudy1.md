A fitness tracker is a miniature data-acquisition system that uses sensors to detect physical characteristics. The sensor signals are conditioned, and then digitized and stored. 
A microcontroller processes the stored data and drives a display. 
With most trackers, the data is sent wirelessly to a smartphone, where an app collects and analyzes the data, and subsequently presents it in a useful way.
The successful tracker relies on good sensors, ones that measure the desired physical characteristic accurately. 
The Components used are as follows:
### Accelerometer: 
This is the 3-axis sensor that tracks motion in all directions. It counts your steps and responds to other movements such as those during sleep. Step counts are then converted into miles walked or run, steps climbed, calories burned, or sleep quality. Some sensors include a gyroscope to determine motion like rotation or physical orientation.
###	Barometer: 
This sensor detects the surrounding air pressure, and uses that measurement to determine altitude. This data is employed in some calculations for fitness performance.
###	Heart-rate monitor: 
This sensor, also referred to as an optical pulse oximeter, counts your heart beats. Heart rate is widely used to determine not only physical activity but stress level, sleep effectiveness, and general well-being.
###	Biopotential: 
This sensor is made of two or more electrodes that are placed against the skin to measure the voltage that occurs across it. The electrical signals detected are generated by the heart muscles, known familiarly as an electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG waveform and its pulses are captured between successive heart pulses. The signal detected can be used for heart-rate monitoring.
###	Bioimpedance:
 Bioimpedance (BioZ) is another factor that can be measured. It’s essentially the resistance between two points on the skin. Two electrodes apply a voltage to the skin and two other electrodes measure the current and calculate the resistance. This measurement can determine how much you sweat, your level of hydration, and respiration rate.
###	Temperature: 
Most trackers don’t have a temperature sensor, but that’s a feature of some models. The sensor may be built-in or come in the form of a patch connected to the tracker.

## Requirements
* Fitness trackers must fit well—not too small, not too big, and be comfortable when wearing for a long period of time.
* Accuracy: Whatever data your activity tracker tracks, it should be accurate and clear to understand.
* Battery Life: For those who wear activity trackers all day or who use fitness trackers during long workouts, a long battery life is key.
* Syncing and connectivity : It should be able to sync with the other 3rd party apps and maintain a connection with the main device.
