# Smart Banking Machine
A system that replaces the ATM cards and PINs by the physiological biometric fingerprint and iris authentication. Moreover, the feature of one time password (OTP) imparts privacy to the users and emancipates him/her from recalling PINs.
 Additionally the system provides protection to the ATM terminal from thief attacks by making provisions of a DC motor for rolling the shutter. In this system during enrollment the genuine user's fingerprint and iris samples of are retained in the database. The process of transaction begins by capturing and matching fingerprints and iris patterns. The system will automatically distinguish between real legitimate trait and fake samples. A GSM module connected to the ARM7 LPC2148 will message a 3-digit code generated by the system to the registered mobile number. After the valid OTP is entered the user can either withdraw or deposit cash or check his/her balance. In any kind of fake access attempts the account is blocked. 

Components used are:
Microcontroller,
Alarm,Buzzer 
GSM, 
Motor,
Finger print sensor,
GSM module(sim900),

## Requirements (High & Low)
* Detection of biometrics is the highest priority for a safer and secure working of this idea.
* The process of sending otp to the registerd user is necessary.
* Incase of wrong multiple attempts blocking process should happen.
* Data should be stored and maintained for proper working of this prototype.
* Theft attacks must be detected.
